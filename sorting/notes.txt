Selection sort:
    select the minimum from the array and swap it with the first element and now sort the remaining array without the first index.
    get the next min and swap it with second element of array

Bubble sort:
    push the largest element to the last.
    2 element pairs are swapped at first over the whole array pushing the largest to the last
    then as the largest element is at the last we ignore it in the second iteration

Insertion Sort:
    in each outer iteration we take the first elem, first 2 elems,first 3 elems....whole array as one sub array
    in the inner iteration / sub array we compare and swap(if neccessary) the largest and the second largest index element an slide a pair down in the indexing till the whole sub array is sorted
    comparison and swap occurs for the whole sub array
